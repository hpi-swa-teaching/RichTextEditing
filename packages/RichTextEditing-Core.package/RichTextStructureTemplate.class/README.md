I am a RichTextStructureTemplate.
I specify an interface for my subclasses (the methods that every vaild template must implement).
Templates offer an option to predefine structures for a certain type of text, which can be accessed by using the method 'initialTextStructures'.

You can also use me to gain information about which templates are avaible.

As I am a static class that does not need to be instantiated, I contain no instance variables.
