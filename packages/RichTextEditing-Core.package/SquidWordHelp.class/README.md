I am a class containing help topics on SquidWord. The help provided by me is included automatically in the Squeak system help.

You can add a new help page by creating a new method on class side returning a HelpTopic and adding the selector of the new method in the #pages method.
It is recommended to edit the text of a help topic using the HelpBrowser.
