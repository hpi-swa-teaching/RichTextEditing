'Save
When the text is saved via the *Save* menu item or the corresponding shortcut/right click menu item, the changes regarding the text and structures are written into a RichTextDocument object.
This document can be inspected by clicking the Document button and Inspect Document afterwards in the editor. It is possible to open the document in another editor by sending the message openInEditor to it.


The *Save as...* menu item found under the *Document* tab lets the user choose a name for the document. The document is then saved in the image (in it''s current state, so make sure to save temporary changes to the document prior to that).

Load
Any document that has been saved using the *Save as...* mechanism can loaded in any other SquidWord instance in your image using the *Load* menu item found under the *Document* tab.!
