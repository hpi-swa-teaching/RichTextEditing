'SquidWord allows you to customize structures and their styles per document using the Structure Editor.

You can launch the Structure Editor by clicking on the "Manage Structures" button in the bottom left corner of a SquidWord instance.

There you can modify the way the structures are displayed (font, text color, text attributes like bold and italic) by first selecting the structure you want to modify on the left and then setting the style for that structure on the right. A preview of the currently selected structure applied to some text is shown in the bottom right.

Using the "+" and "-" buttons you can create additional structures or remove existing ones.

Using the "Up" and "Down" buttons you can rearrange the structures in the list. Attributes like color of structures at the top of the list take priority over the same attributes with different values lower in the list if multiple structures are applied to the same text. The order of the structures in the main editor is the same as the order in the structure editor and affects the shortcuts for text structures (see "Keyboard Shortcuts").

Additionally, you can select a new styles template for your text.
Selecting a template in the list to the left and then clicking the "Accept Template" button (and the "Select template" button in the appearing confirmation window) will replace the currently configured structures with the ones that are predifined for that template. 
The formatting of the current document will be converted, as long as matching structures can be found in the new template.
Note that, after a template has been selected, changes to the appearing structures won''t be saved back to the template and are specific to the document you are editing.!
