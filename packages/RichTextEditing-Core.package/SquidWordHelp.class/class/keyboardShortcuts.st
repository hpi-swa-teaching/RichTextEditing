'Structuring
Ctrl-Shift-[1,2,...,0]	toggle 1st, 2nd, ... or 10th structure from the top of the structure list
The default settings work only for an american keyboard layout. Netherless you can change the structure keymap by visiting the SquidWord category in the Preference Browser and changing the Structure keyboard shortcuts to something that matches your layout. Be warned that not all keys will work, as some shortcuts are already in use by Squeak.
