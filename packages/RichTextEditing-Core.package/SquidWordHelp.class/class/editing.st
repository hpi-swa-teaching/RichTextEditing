'In SquidWord, text can be divided into logical units. Paragraphs are used to structure the text into sections on a broad level and so-called "text structures" are used to assign certain meanings to particular parts of the text.

Paragraphs
Pressing Enter inserts a Paragraph, pressing Shift-Enter insert a normal line break. The paragraph is visible by an increased line height.

Structures
Structures can be applied to portions of the text by selecting the particular text and selecting the structures from the list of available structures on the left-hand side or using the automatic shortcuts.
They can also be completly customized with regards to emphasis, color, font and indentation. For more info on that see the page regarding the Structure Editor.
