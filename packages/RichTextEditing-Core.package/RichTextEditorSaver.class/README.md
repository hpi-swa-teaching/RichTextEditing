I am a RichTextEditorSaver. You can use me to save and load aRichTextDocument under a name (should also work with other objects). 
For saving a document use my method addSave: aDocument underName: aString, for loading a document use loadDocumentFromName: aString.

My instance variable is:
documents - aDictionary
